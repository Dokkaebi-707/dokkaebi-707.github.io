									<h2 class="major">1V1 VR</h2>
									<p>A dream of mine that I've been working on the hardest and the longest.
										1V1 VR is a multiplayer VR FPS game that focuses on tactical decisions in pure 
										skill based combat in CQB areas ranging from the back room of a hardware store
										to the roof of a Korean night club. Featuring a self-made ranking algorithm for
										finding opponents truly within one's skill level, a progression system linked to
										user accounts with a built-in shop system (fully controlled by a database), and even
										co-op modes to play with your friends and complete unique challenges with every mission.
									</p>

									<p>All throughout middle school, and even now, I have always wanted my own game like this, but not
										just for the sake of creating it. It was because there was nothing like it, and that's exactly
										what players wanted.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Showcases</h2>
									<p>Below are just a few screenshots of the art I created for the game, including character model design as well
										as weapon models.</p>

										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/aks74u.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">AKS-74U Weapon Model</h3>
											<p>The icon used for the default skinned AKS-74U in 1V1 VR. Modelled
												and rigged entirely in Blender along with a single material texture.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/gold.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Golden AKS-74U Skin</h3>
											<p>The icon used for the golden AKS-74U in 1V1 VR. This one in
												particular is special because the shader used for the gold
												material was written by me for a certain shine that I wanted
												which was not available with the default Unity shader.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/default.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Default Player Model</h3>
											<p>The default player model concept used in 1V1 VR. Fully rigged
												and modelled in Blender, it has the ability to use multiple unique
												headgear pieces which allows for further customization besides
												uniform skins in-game.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/beta.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Unique Beta Skin Concept</h3>
											<p>The first concept I made for a unique Beta Tester skin for 1V1 VR.
												Utilizing the efficieny of a single material texture, adding decals
												to the texture as well as changing certain colors and patterns made
												the overall skin look fantastic and exclusive for those who received it.
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/s5.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Silver 5 Rank</h3>
											<p>The icon used for the rank "Silver 5" in 1V1 VR. All icons were made to be perfectly
												scalable at any resolution so that it can be used in many cases (user profile page,
												glancing at a small overview of a user, or just seeing their rank next to their name in-game).
											</p>
										</article>
										<article>
											<a class="image"><img src="images/d2.png" alt="" /></a>
											<h3 class="major">Diamond 2 Rank</h3>
											<p>The icon used for the rank "Diamond 2" in 1V1 VR. Following the same idea
												behind the Silver rank, just another visualization of different material usage.
